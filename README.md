# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Project Overview
Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis, we learned about data modeling engineering, and analysis. We created entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), imported data into a database, troubleshot common errors, created queries and joint tables that use data to answer questions using SQL techniques.

##Resources## 
The Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis module uses PostgreSQL which required pgAdmin to be installed. Visit the PostgresSQL ÔºÅ[download website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) to initiate your download.

* Resources: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
* ftware: Postgres, pgAdmin
For more about PostgreSQL, see:

The PostgreSQL documentation https://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/
The PostgreSQL tutorial https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/


## Objectives
* Design an ERD that applies to the data.
* Create and use a SQL database.
* Import and export large CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
* Practice using different joins to create new tables in pgAdmin.
* Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.

## Challenge Overview 

* Use an ERD to understand relationships between SQL tables.
* Create new tables in pgAdmin by using different joins.
* Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.
* Export new tables to a CSV file.

##Challenge Summary##

* EmployeeDB ERD

Before we conduct any analysis or queries, it is important to create ERD to understand the relationship amongs all the tables and identified the PK(Primary Key) and FK(Foreign Key).

After the analysis, we come up below results.

* 41380 indivisuals retiring 
* 33118 employees currently employed 
* 1549 individuals are ready for memtorship
